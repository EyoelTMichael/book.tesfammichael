# Introduction to Calculus

Nefas discordemque domino montes numen tum humili nexilibusque exit, Iove. Quae
miror esse, scelerisque Melaneus viribus. Miseri laurus. Hoc est proposita me
ante aliquid, aura inponere candidioribus quidque accendit bella, sumpta.
Intravit quam erat figentem hunc, motus de fontes parvo tempestate.

## Pre requisits

although i try to explain topics as easly as i can missing some core math concepts would make it a huge challenge for some of us, i made the list below as something you should be familiar with, not as you should be able to solve complex problems, having a good understanding of these list would make the Calculus jouney easier.

    *  Basic Highschool maths
    *  Linear Algebra 
        (still from your highschool math is enough)
    *  Basic Vector Manupulations 
        (still from your highschool math is enough)
